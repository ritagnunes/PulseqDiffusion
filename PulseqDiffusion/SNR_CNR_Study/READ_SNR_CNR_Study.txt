Description

This is a Script that predicts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observed for
different brain tissues (gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid - CSF) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of an acute stroke
lesion relative to those tissues. The implemented code predicts the 
SNR and CNR per time unit for a spin-echo diffusion-weighted sequence, 
taking into account the steady-state value for the longitudinal
magnetization. For that purpose, we adapted an expression used to
predict the SNR per tissue per time unit for a spoiled gradient echo
sequence (Marques, JP et al, 2019). This simulation considers the possibility to use either EPI or spiral readouts and considers the impact of: B0, max gradient amplitude, spatial resolution and b-value (comparing the achieved SNR with that of a typical 1.5T clinical scanner).

How to run the SNR & CNR Study Simulation?

1 - Run file 'SNR_CNR_Study/runTests_SNR_CNR_Study.m' to perform unit test on all function and scripts of this toolbox
2 - Open file 'SNR_CNR_Study/SNR_CNR_Study_Simulation.m'
3 - Before running it using Matlab, modify the input simulation values according to what you are interested in testing
4 - Run the script 'SNR_CNR_Study_Simulation.m' - all other functions are called within this script.
