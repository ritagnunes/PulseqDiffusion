# Summary

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisitions consist of the sequential application of radio-frequency and magnetic field gradient pulses. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a widely used type of MRI pulse sequence providing a key image contrast for clinical brain applications such as stroke imaging [@schellinger2010stroke]. 

Developing new acquisition strategies for DWI acquisition typically requires access to and expertise on the programming environment of the MRI vendor. Pulseq [@layton2017pulseq] is an open source file standard for pulse sequences that enables to deploy the exact same protocol on both Siemens/GE via [TOPPE](https://toppemri.github.io)
[@nielsen2018toppe] and [Bruker](https://github.com/pulseq/bruker_interpreter) platforms, and potentially also on in-house built MRI systems. In this work we introduce `PulseqDiffusion` to enable open-source DWI pulse sequence programming, using PyPulseq [@ravi2019pypulseqjoss; @ravi2018pulseq-gpi], a Python-based implementation of Pulseq [@layton2017pulseq].
We have leveraged this tool for published research works [@nunes2020dwpypulseq; @fernandes2020snr]. 


# Statement of need
Multiple freely available open-source image processing tools have been developed for DWI such as MRtrix3 [@tournier2019mrtrix], DiPy [@garyfallidis2014dipy], and dedicated tools in FSL [@jenkinson2012fsl]. However, vendor-neutral open-source acquisition implementations have not been previously shared. 

There has been a growing interest in developing open-source solutions for MRI, aiming to improve its accessibility (www.opensourceimaging.org). `PulseqDiffusion` will allow easier prototyping of DWI sequences and enable cross-vendor comparisons in clinical scanners.
We also expect `PulseqDiffusion` to be a useful starting point for sequence development in the context of accessible low-field stroke imaging [@geethanath19lowfield].

The gradient waveforms applied along all three directions are shown above while the signal acquisition (ADC) and RF pulse waveforms are shown below.](tre_seq.png)

The sets of diffusion gradient directions considered for pulse sequence implementation were optimised using MRtrix3 (https://www.mrtrix.org/, [@tournier2019mrtrix]). 

We provide example data as well as Matlab functions for basic reconstruction and image processing. Phantom images reconstructed from the provided example k-space data, including four different levels of diffusion-weighting along three orthogonal directions, as well as the corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, are displayed: 

![Diffusion-weighted images obtained for a doped water bottle phantom including four different levels of diffusion-weighting (250 to 1000 s/mm^2) and corresponding ADC maps for three orthogonal directions.](Phantom_ADC.png)

Note that the measured ADC value is within the expected value for water at room temperature (2.0x10^{-3} mm^2/s). 

For image processing, we employ widely used open-source software tools, including the matlab toolbox for dealing with Nifti images (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image) and FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki, [@jenkinson2012fsl]) for image pre-processing and diffusion tensor estimation. In vivo images reconstructed from the provided k-space data are shown for different levels of diffusion-weighting sampled along three orthogonal directions: 

![In vivo diffusion-weighted images corresponding to different diffusion-weighting levels along three orthogonal directions.](InVivo3dirs.png)
 These images and diffusion maps were obtained using the process_data matlab script.

The principal eigenvector estimated for a 12 direction in vivo data set provided as example is shown here:

# About `PulseqDiffusion` 
Together with the Python functions required to generate DWI sequences, we provide a tool for simulating the performance of different sequence variants considering a range of hardware solutions [@fernandes2020snr]. This tool predicts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observed for different brain tissues (gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid - CSF) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of an acute stroke lesion relative to those tissues, and can be found in jMRI_Publication_Functions. The implemented code predicts the SNR and CNR per time unit for a spin-echo diffusion-weighted sequence, taking into account the steady-state value for the longitudinal magnetization. For that purpose, we adapted an expression used to predict the SNR per tissue per time unit for a spoiled gradient echo sequence [@marques2019lowfield]. This simulation considers the possibility to use either EPI or spiral readouts and considers the impact of: B0, maximum gradient amplitude, spatial resolution and level of diffusion-weighting (comparing the achieved SNR with that of a typical 1.5T clinical scanner).

We provide Python scripts for generating example diffusion-weighted EPI sequences including single-spin echo preparation (with and without ramp-sampling during signal readout) and a doubly-refocused preparation module [@reese2013tre] as shown below: 
# Target audience
`PulseqDiffusion` is aimed at MRI researchers focusing on DWI pulse sequence design. We envisage `PulseqDiffusion` to be used for replicability and reproducibility studies (multi-site, multi-vendor). The package could also serve as a hands-on teaching aid for MRI faculty and students. Users can get started with the example pulse sequences and provided phantom and in vivo data.
